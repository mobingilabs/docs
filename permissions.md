## Permissions

The following tables list all supported permissions under Mobingi RBAC across all namespaces.

* The permissions are hierarchical. Any user with permissions in the higher hierarchy will have permissions in the lower hierarchy as well. For example, `Admin` will have all permissions in the respective namespace.
* Some permissions can have resources filter. Empty filter will mean all resources allowed. Resources filter also follow the same hierarchical logic and only `Allow` effect is supported as of now.
