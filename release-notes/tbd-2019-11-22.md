* We have opened up a beta version of both [Ripple](https://next.alphaus.cloud/ripple/) and [Wave](https://next.alphaus.cloud/wave/), called **NEXT**. From now on, when we add new features to our products, these features will be available first in NEXT, then to our production. If you already have accounts in Ripple and Wave, you can use those accounts to login to NEXT and play around with it. Once these features are fully tested, they will be released to our production environment.
